    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>The <strong>Front-end</strong> is one of my passions: I like to integrate or imagine modern interfaces, make them responsive and energize them with elegant animations. My two favorite technologies are <strong>TailWind</strong> & <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.</p>
    <p>
    Resourceful and independent in my work, I enjoy learning new technologies, spending time solving problems and producing quality code. My work values : clean code, flexibility, performance and seriousness.
